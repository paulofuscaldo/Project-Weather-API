### Project-Weather-API

#### In this project, I developed a Python application that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a specific city. The application prompts the user to input a city name, fetches the current weather information from the API, and displays it to the user.

#### Tutorials from Andy's Tech Tutorials inspired the project. Specifically, I found the following tutorials helpful:
